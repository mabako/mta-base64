* INTRODUCTION
    This is the 'base64' module that exports the standard interface used by
    the Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas Deathmatch server and it's Lua scripting
    engine to allow C/C++ developers to add functionality to their servers.

    The functions provided by this plugin are base64_decode() and base64_encode()

* INSTALLATION
    In order to install your module, first make sure it compiles correctly and
    verify that it can be executed. When using external library dependencies
    in the form of a shared library (.so or .dll file) you will have to place
    the library inside the directory of the MTA:SA DM server executable.

    To load your module at server initialisation, use the module configuration
    tag syntax as specified in your mtaserver.conf file:

    <!-- <module>sample_win32.dll</module> -->
    <!-- <module>sample_linux.so</module> -->

    Place your module library inside the mods/deathmatch/modules directory.
    Be sure to create this directory if it does not exist.
